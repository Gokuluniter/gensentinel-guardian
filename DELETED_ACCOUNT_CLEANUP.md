# Deleted Account Cleanup Implementation

## Problem
After deleting a test account, the admin panel still showed activity logs, audit trail entries, and threats from the deleted user. This caused confusion as the data from problematic accounts remained visible even after deletion.

## Solution
Implemented **client-side filtering** to exclude logs and threats from deleted users (where the profile no longer exists).

## Changes Made

### 1. Activity Logs (`src/pages/ActivityLogs.tsx`)
- Added filter to exclude activities where `profiles` is `null`
- Only valid activities (with existing user profiles) are displayed

### 2. Audit Trail (`src/pages/AuditTrail.tsx`)
- Added filter to exclude audit logs where `profiles` is `null`
- Ensures only logs from active users are shown

### 3. Threat Monitor (`src/pages/ThreatMonitor.tsx`)
- Added filter to exclude threats where `user` profile is `null`
- Only threats from existing users are displayed

### 4. Dashboard (`src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`)
- Added filters for both recent threats and recent activities
- Excludes any data from deleted user profiles

## How It Works

When a test account is deleted via `test-threat-detection.html`:
1. The profile is deleted from the `profiles` table
2. All related data (activities, ML predictions, threats, notifications) is deleted via the cascade deletion in the script
3. **Frontend Filtering**: Any remaining orphaned records (if cascade fails) are filtered out in the UI by checking if `profiles !== null`

## Result

After deleting a test account:
- ✅ Activity logs from that user disappear from the admin panel
- ✅ Audit trail entries from that user are hidden
- ✅ Threats from that user are no longer visible
- ✅ Dashboard stats and recent items no longer include deleted users
- ✅ Overall security score calculations no longer include problematic deleted accounts

## Technical Details

**SQL Join Behavior**: When fetching data with `.select('*, profiles(...)')`, if the profile is deleted:
- The main record (activity_log, threat_detection) still exists in the database
- The joined `profiles` field returns `null`
- Our filter checks for `profiles !== null` (or `user !== null` for threats)
- Records with `null` profiles are excluded from the UI

**Why Not Database-Level CASCADE?**
- We're already using manual cascade deletion in the test script
- This client-side filtering acts as a **safety net** for any orphaned records
- It's more flexible and doesn't require schema changes

## Testing

1. Create a test account via `test-threat-detection.html`
2. Perform activities to populate logs
3. Check admin panel - you should see the activities, audit logs, and threats
4. Delete the test account via `test-threat-detection.html`
5. Refresh the admin panel - all data from that account should disappear
6. Organization-wide stats should improve (fewer threats, better overall score perception)

## Notes

- This is a **display-level fix** - the actual database cleanup is handled by the test script
- If cascade deletion in the script fails, orphaned records won't cause UI issues due to this filtering
- Regular users can't see other users' data anyway, so this primarily affects admin and security officer views
