# 🤖 XAI Enhancements - Plain Text & Score-Aware Explanations

## ✅ **What We've Implemented**

### **1. Plain Text Formatting (No Markdown)**

#### **Problem Solved:**
- Gemini 2.5 Flash was generating responses with asterisks (**bold**, *italic*)
- Markdown formatting looked messy in the UI
- Special characters cluttered the explanations

#### **Solution Implemented:**
✅ **cleanMarkdown() Function**
```typescript
function cleanMarkdown(text: string): string {
  return text
    .replace(/\*\*(.+?)\*\*/g, '$1')  // Remove **bold**
    .replace(/__(.+?)__/g, '$1')      // Remove __bold__
    .replace(/\*(.+?)\*/g, '$1')      // Remove *italic*
    .replace(/_(.+?)_/g, '$1')        // Remove _italic_
    .replace(/`(.+?)`/g, '$1')        // Remove `code`
    .replace(/\*/g, '')               // Remove remaining *
    .trim();
}
```

✅ **Applied to all AI responses:**
- Lovable AI Gateway responses → cleaned
- Google Gemini Direct responses → cleaned
- Fallback explanations → already plain text

### **2. Explicit Plain Text Instructions**

#### **Updated Prompts:**

**System Prompt (Lovable AI):**
```
You are an expert cybersecurity analyst providing clear, actionable 
explanations of security alerts. IMPORTANT: Write in plain text only. 
Do NOT use asterisks, markdown formatting, or special characters. 
Use simple paragraphs and numbered lists.
```

**System Prompt (Gemini Direct):**
```
You are an expert cybersecurity analyst. CRITICAL: Write ONLY in plain text. 
DO NOT use asterisks (*), markdown, or any special formatting. 
Use simple sentences and numbered lists.
```

**User Prompt Instructions:**
```
IMPORTANT FORMATTING RULES:
- DO NOT use asterisks (*) or any markdown formatting
- Use plain text only
- Use line breaks for paragraph separation
- Use numbers (1., 2., 3.) for lists
- Use colons (:) for emphasis instead of bold
```

### **3. Score-Aware Explanations**

#### **Enhanced Context Provided to AI:**

**Before:**
```typescript
- Security Score: 70 → 50 (decreased by 20 points)
```

**After:**
```typescript
- Current Security Score: 50/100 (previously 70/100)
- Score Change: decreased by 20 points
- Threat Level: CRITICAL
- ML Threat Probability: 95.3%
- Detected Threat Type: data exfiltration
- Anomaly Score: 0.897
```

#### **AI Now Explains:**
1. ✅ **What Happened** - The suspicious activity
2. ✅ **Why This Matters** - ML model findings and risk
3. ✅ **Impact on Score** - **NEW!** Why the score changed
4. ✅ **Recommended Actions** - Specific steps to take
5. ✅ **Next Steps** - What happens if score drops further

---

### **4. Improved Fallback Explanations**

#### **Before:**
```
Your security score dropped from 70 to 50.
```

#### **After:**
```
Your security score dropped by 20 points from 70 to 50.

Impact on Score:
The security score dropped by 20 points because this represents 
a significant security risk.
```

**Fallback Now Includes:**
- ✅ Exact score change calculation
- ✅ Context-aware reasoning:
  - `> 20 points drop` → "critical threat requiring immediate attention"
  - `> 10 points drop` → "significant security risk"
  - `> 0 points drop` → "deviates from normal behavior"
  - `< 0 (increase)` → "improved security posture"
  - `= 0 (no change)` → "neither harmful nor beneficial"
- ✅ Urgency warnings for scores < 50

### **5. ML + AI Working Together**

#### **How They Collaborate:**

**ML Models (Python API):**
1. Analyze activity patterns
2. Calculate threat probability
3. Generate anomaly scores
4. Classify threat type
5. Return prediction to Edge Function

**AI (Gemini/Lovable):**
1. Receives ML predictions
2. Receives current & previous score
3. Contextualizes the threat
4. Explains why score changed
5. Provides actionable recommendations

**Edge Function (Orchestrator):**
```typescript
// Sends to AI:
const context = {
  ml_prediction: {
    threat_probability: 0.95,
    anomaly_score: 0.897,
    threat_type: 'data_exfiltration'
  },
  score: 50,
  previous_score: 70,
  threat_level: 'critical'
};

// AI generates explanation considering:
// - ML findings
// - Score impact
// - User context
// - Recommended actions
```

---

## 📊 **Example XAI Output**

### **Before (with markdown):**
```
**Security Alert: CRITICAL Activity Detected**

**What Happened:**
Our ML models detected **data exfiltration** activity...

**Impact:**
Your score *dropped* from **70** to **50**...
```

### **After (plain text):**
```
Security Alert: CRITICAL Activity Detected

What Happened:
Our machine learning models detected a data exfiltration attempt 
where 1371MB of sensitive data was exported to an external location. 
This is highly unusual and represents a severe security breach.

Why This Matters:
The ML models flagged this with 95.3% threat probability - one of 
the highest confidence scores possible. The anomaly score of 0.897 
indicates this activity is completely outside your normal behavior pattern.

Impact on Score:
Your security score dropped by 20 points from 70 to 50 because this 
is a critical threat requiring immediate attention. Large unauthorized 
data exports are one of the most serious security incidents.

Recommended Actions:
1. Immediately review all data export activities in your Activity Log
2. Contact your security administrator right away - do not delay
3. Change your password and review account access permissions
4. URGENT: Your score is critically low. Contact security team now.

Next Steps:
If additional suspicious activities are detected, your account may be 
temporarily restricted to prevent further data loss. Work with your 
security team to investigate and resolve this incident.

## 📝 **Example Score Change Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Critical Threat (Score drops 20+)**
```
Your security score dropped by 23 points from 80 to 57.

Impact on Score:
The security score dropped by 23 points because this is a critical 
threat requiring immediate attention. The ML models detected highly 
suspicious behavior with 98% confidence.
```

### **Scenario 2: Normal Activity (Score increases)**
```
Your security score increased by 1 point from 75 to 76.

Impact on Score:
The security score increased by 1 point because this was normal, 
safe activity that improved your security posture. Regular, expected 
activities help maintain a healthy security score.
```

### **Scenario 3: Minor Anomaly (Score drops 5-10)**
```
Your security score dropped by 8 points from 85 to 77.

Impact on Score:
The security score dropped by 8 points because this activity deviates 
from your normal behavior pattern. While not critical, it warrants 
review to ensure it was authorized.
```
