# ML Integration Summary - Complete Implementation Report

## 🎯 Project Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All ML prediction models have been successfully integrated into the GenSentinel Guardian application.

---

## 📋 What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Layer ✅

**New Migration Created:** `supabase/migrations/20251004120000_create_ml_predictions_table.sql`

**New Table: `ml_threat_predictions`**
- Stores all ML model predictions
- Tracks individual model scores (Supervised, Isolation Forest, LSTM)
- Maintains feature importance data
- Includes review workflow (reviewed_at, reviewed_by)
- Auto-blocking and review flags
- Full RLS (Row Level Security) policies

**Updated Table: `threat_detections`**
- Added `ml_prediction_id` reference
- Added `detection_method` enum ('rule_based', 'ml_based', 'hybrid')

**Performance Optimizations:**
- 6 new indexes for fast queries
- Optimized RLS policies
- Proper foreign key constraints

---

### 2. Backend Integration ✅

#### **New Edge Function:** `supabase/functions/get-threat-prediction/index.ts`
**Purpose:** Proxy between React frontend and Python ML API on AWS

**Features:**
- CORS handling
- Authentication pass-through
- Error handling with detailed logging
- Routes to: `https://4esjyecm9k.ap-south-1.awsapprunner.com/predict`

**Request Format:**
```typescript
{
  activity_id: string,
  user_id: string,
  activity_type: string,
  description: string,
  timestamp: string,
  metadata: {
    hour_of_day: number,
    day_of_week: number,
    current_security_score: number,
    // ... other features
  }
}
```

**Response Format:**
```typescript
{
  is_threat: boolean,
  threat_type: string,
  threat_level: string,
  ensemble_probability: number,
  ensemble_confidence: number,
  supervised_prediction: string,
  anomaly_score: number,
  sequence_anomaly_score: number,
  model_versions: {...},
  feature_importance: {...},
  explanation: string
}
```

#### **Updated Edge Function:** `supabase/functions/ingest-activity/index.ts`
**Major Changes:**
- Integrated ML prediction API call
- Enhanced threat analysis logic
- Improved security score calculation (ML-aware)
- Better XAI trigger logic
- Fallback to rule-based detection if ML fails
- Saves ML predictions to database
- Links predictions to threat detections

**Flow:**
1. Receive activity from external system
2. Insert into `activity_logs`
3. Call `get-threat-prediction` function
4. Process ML response
5. Save to `ml_threat_predictions`
6. Update security score
7. Create threat detection if needed
8. Trigger XAI explanation if critical
9. Send notifications if threshold crossed

**Rule-Based Fallback:**
- If ML API unavailable, uses rule-based detection
- No disruption to service
- Logs which method was used
- Maintains all functionality

---

### 3. Frontend Components ✅

#### **New Hook:** `src/hooks/useMLPredictions.ts`
**Purpose:** Fetch and manage ML predictions

**Features:**

  total: number,
  threats: number,
  safe: number,
  pending_review: number,
  auto_blocked: number,
  high_confidence: number,
  avg_threat_probability: number
}
```

**Usage Example:**
```typescript
const { 
  predictions,    // Array of predictions
  stats,         // Aggregated stats
  loading,       // Loading state
  error,         // Error state
