# Main Application Fixes - GenSentinel Guardian

## Issues Fixed

### ‚úÖ 1. Activity Logs Not Showing in Admin Dashboard

**Problem**: Activity logs created via test script weren't visible in the main application's admin dashboard.

**Root Cause**: RLS policies were too restrictive.

**Solution**:
1. Run the SQL script `fix-activity-logs-visibility.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
2. This updates RLS policies to allow:
   - Admins to see all activity logs in their organization
   - Security officers to see all logs
   - Department heads to see their department's logs
   - Users to see their own logs

**To Apply**:
```bash
# Open Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor ‚Üí paste and run:
cat fix-activity-logs-visibility.sql
```

---

### ‚úÖ 2. Audit Trail Empty

**Problem**: Same as Activity Logs - RLS policies blocking access.

**Solution**: Fixed by the same SQL script above (`fix-activity-logs-visibility.sql`).

---

### ‚úÖ 3. Account Blocking When Score Drops Below Threshold

**Problem**: Users with low security scores could still log in and perform activities.

**Solution**: Implemented automatic account blocking in `ingest-activity` Edge Function.

**Features**:
- ‚ùå **Account blocked when security score < 30**
- üîí `is_active` flag set to `false` in profiles table
- üö® Critical notification sent to user
- üìß Admin notified of blocked account

**Behavior**:
```
Score 100-30: Account active ‚úÖ
Score 29 or below: Account blocked ‚ùå
```

### ‚úÖ 4. XAI (Explainable AI) Not Working

**Problem**: XAI explanations weren't being generated for threat detections.

**Solution**: Enhanced XAI integration in threat detection flow.

**Features**:
- ü§ñ XAI called for ALL medium/high/critical threats
- üìù Generates human-readable explanations using Google Gemini 2.5 Flash
- üîÑ Fallback to default explanation if XAI fails
- ‚úÖ Explanations stored in `threat_detections` table

**Requirements**:
- Set `LOVABLE_API_KEY` in Supabase Edge Function Secrets
- Get key from: https://lovable.dev/projects/[your-project]/api-keys

## How to Test

### Step 1: Apply SQL Fixes
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
-- (Contents of fix-activity-logs-visibility.sql)
```

### Step 2: Test Activity Logging
1. Open `test-threat-detection.html`
2. Login to test account
3. Perform some activities
4. Open main app ‚Üí Login as admin
5. Go to "Activity Logs" tab
6. ‚úÖ You should see all activities from test script

### Step 3: Test Audit Trail
1. In main app (as admin)
2. Go to "Audit Trail" tab
3. ‚úÖ You should see all activities with user details

### Step 4: Test Account Blocking
1. In `test-threat-detection.html`
2. Check current security score (should show in UI)
3. Perform multiple critical threats until score < 30:
   - Data Exfiltration (-23 points)
   - Unauthorized Config (-20 points for high, -5 for others)
   - Multiple Failed Logins (-30 points)
4. ‚úÖ Account should be blocked
5. ‚úÖ Notification: "üö® Account Blocked - Security Score Too Low"
6. Try to perform another activity ‚Üí should fail or show blocked message

### Step 5: Test XAI Explanations
1. Set `LOVABLE_API_KEY` in Supabase (if not already set)
2. Perform a critical threat activity
3. Check `threat_detections` table in Supabase:
```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  threat_type,
  threat_level,
  ai_explanation,
  created_at
FROM threat_detections
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
4. ‚úÖ `ai_explanation` should contain detailed, human-readable explanation

## Deployment Checklist

- [x] Update `ingest-activity` Edge Function (deployed ‚úÖ)
- [ ] Run `fix-activity-logs-visibility.sql` in Supabase
- [ ] Set `LOVABLE_API_KEY` environment variable
- [ ] Test activity logs visibility in admin dashboard
- [ ] Test account blocking with low security score
- [ ] Verify XAI explanations in threat detections
- [ ] Test end-to-end flow in main application

---

## Environment Variables Required

Add these in Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Edge Functions ‚Üí Manage Secrets:

```
LOVABLE_API_KEY=your_lovable_ai_key_here
```

Get your key from Lovable.dev project settings.

## Database Schema Changes

No schema changes required - all fixes use existing tables and columns.

---

## Summary of Changes

| File | Changes Made |
|------|-------------|
| `supabase/functions/ingest-activity/index.ts` | ‚Ä¢ Added account blocking logic (score < 30)<br>‚Ä¢ Added blocked account notifications<br>‚Ä¢ Enhanced XAI integration for all threats<br>‚Ä¢ Added fallback XAI explanations |
| `fix-activity-logs-visibility.sql` | ‚Ä¢ New RLS policies for activity_logs<br>‚Ä¢ Allow admin/security officer full access<br>‚Ä¢ Allow department head department access<br>‚Ä¢ Allow INSERT for all authenticated users |

---

## Next Steps

1. **Run the SQL script** in Supabase SQL Editor
2. **Set LOVABLE_API_KEY** environment variable
3. **Test in main application**:
   - Login as admin
   - Check Activity Logs tab
   - Check Audit Trail tab
   - Verify threat detections have XAI explanations
4. **Test account blocking**:
   - Use test script to drop score below 30
   - Verify account is blocked
   - Verify notification is created
5. **Verify XAI** is generating explanations for all threats

---

## Troubleshooting

### Activity Logs Still Empty?
- Check if RLS policies were applied: Run `\dp activity_logs` in SQL editor
- Check if activities have proper `user_id` (should be UUID, not employee_id)
- Verify you're logged in as admin in main app

### Account Not Blocking?
- Check `is_active` flag in profiles table
- Verify security score is actually < 30
- Check Edge Function logs for errors

### XAI Not Working?
- Verify `LOVABLE_API_KEY` is set in Edge Function secrets
- Check Edge Function logs: `npx supabase functions logs generate-xai-explanation`
- Verify Lovable AI API is accessible
- Check if fallback explanation is being used (still works without API key)

For issues or questions, check the Edge Function logs:
```bash
npx supabase functions logs ingest-activity --limit 50
npx supabase functions logs generate-xai-explanation --limit 20
```
