## Upgrade Guide

### From 1.x to 2.0

1. **Run new migration:**
   ```bash
   npx supabase db push
   ```

2. **Deploy new Edge Functions:**
   ```bash
   npx supabase functions deploy ingest-activity
   npx supabase functions deploy get-threat-prediction
   ```

3. **Update frontend:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Verify ML API:**
   - Test AWS App Runner endpoint
   - Check Edge Function logs
   - Create test activity and verify prediction

5. **Data Migration (if needed):**
   - Existing threat_detections remain unchanged
   - New activities will automatically get ML predictions
   - No data loss or downtime
