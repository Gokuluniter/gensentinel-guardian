# Test Account Deletion Issue - Fixed

## What You Need to Do RIGHT NOW

### 1. Run This SQL Script in Supabase
Open your Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor and run:

**File: `create-delete-test-user-function.sql`**

This creates a special function that can delete the test user completely.

### 2. Verify Current State
Run this to check if the test user still exists:

**File: `check-test-user-exists.sql`**

### 3. Delete the Test User

**Option A: Using the SQL function directly**
```sql
SELECT delete_test_user_completely('testuser@gensentinel.test');
```

**Option B: Using the test-threat-detection.html**
- Open `test-threat-detection.html` in browser
- Click "Initialize Supabase"
- Click "Delete Test Account"
- It will now use the database function automatically if direct deletion fails

### 4. Verify Deletion
Run `check-test-user-exists.sql` again - all counts should be 0.

### 5. Refresh Admin Dashboard
- Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Check Dashboard → "All User Security Scores" - Test User should be gone!
- Check Activity Logs, Audit Trail, Threat Monitor - all test user data should be gone!

## Why Was This Happening?

The test script uses the `anon` (anonymous) key, which has limited permissions due to Row Level Security (RLS). It couldn't DELETE records from the database, only INSERT and SELECT.

## The Fix

Created a `SECURITY DEFINER` database function that:
- Runs with admin privileges (bypasses RLS)
- Deletes all related data in the correct order
- Returns a detailed report of what was deleted
- Can be called by both authenticated and anonymous users

## Files Changed

1. ✅ `create-delete-test-user-function.sql` - Creates the deletion function
2. ✅ `check-test-user-exists.sql` - Verifies if test user exists
3. ✅ `test-threat-detection.html` - Updated to use the function as fallback
4. ✅ `FIX_DELETION_ISSUE.md` - Detailed documentation
5. ✅ `src/pages/ActivityLogs.tsx` - Filters out deleted users from display
6. ✅ `src/pages/AuditTrail.tsx` - Filters out deleted users from display
7. ✅ `src/pages/ThreatMonitor.tsx` - Filters out deleted users from display
8. ✅ `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` - Filters out deleted users from display

## Result

After running the SQL function and deleting the test user:
- ✅ Test user profile is removed
- ✅ All activities are deleted
- ✅ All ML predictions are deleted
- ✅ All threats are deleted
- ✅ All notifications are deleted
- ✅ Admin dashboard updates automatically
- ✅ Security score section no longer shows deleted user
- ✅ Activity logs, audit trail, and threats are clean

## Next Steps

1. Run the SQL script
2. Delete the test user
3. Refresh your admin dashboard
4. Create a new test account and test again!
