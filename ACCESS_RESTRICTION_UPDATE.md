   - Projects → Blocked
   - Reports → Blocked  
   - Messages → Blocked
   - Calendar → Blocked

   - Settings → Blocked
   - Any other page → Blocked

4. **Warning screen is shown** 🚨
   When user tries to access a blocked tab, they see:
   
   ```
   ⚠️ Access Restricted
   
   Your account access has been limited due to low security score
   
   Current Security Score: 23/100
   Minimum required: 30
   
   Why is my access restricted?
   Multiple suspicious activities have been detected on your account...
   
   What should I do?
   • Contact your system administrator
   • Review recent activity logs
   • Report suspicious activities
   • Change your password
   
   [Return to Dashboard] [View Security Alerts]
   ```

5. **Notification is sent** 📧
   ```
   Title: "🚨 Access Restricted - Security Score Critical"
   Message: "Your account access has been restricted due to security 
   score dropping to 23/100. You can only access the dashboard. Please

   ```

## 🧪 Testing the New Behavior

### Step 1: Lower Security Score
1. Open `test-threat-detection.html`
2. Login to test account
3. Perform multiple critical threats until score < 30:

   - Repeat 3-4 times to drop below 30

### Step 2: Verify Restriction in Main App
1. **Open main application**
2. **Login with restricted account** (testuser@gensentinel.test)
3. ✅ **Login should work**
4. ✅ **Dashboard should load**
5. **Try to click any other tab** (Documents, Projects, etc.)
6. ✅ **Should see warning popup** blocking access

### Step 3: Check Notification
1. On dashboard, click Notifications
2. ✅ Should see "Access Restricted" notification

## 💡 Important Notes

### 1. Dashboard-Only Access
When restricted, users can ONLY access:
- `/dashboard` - Main dashboard
- `/notifications` - To see alerts (if allowed)

Everything else is blocked with the warning screen.

### 2. No Account Disabling
- `is_active` flag remains `true`
- User can login anytime
- Restriction is enforced at page level, not auth level

### 3. Reversibility  
To restore full access:
- Admin manually increases security score to 30+
- Or user's score naturally increases through normal activities
- Once score >= 30, all tabs become accessible again

---

## 🔄 How to Restore Access

### Method 1: Admin Manual Fix
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
UPDATE profiles
SET security_score = 100
WHERE email = 'testuser@gensentinel.test';
```

### Method 2: Natural Recovery
- User performs normal activities on dashboard
- Each normal activity: +1 point
- Restricted users can't perform activities, so this won't work automatically
- Requires admin intervention
